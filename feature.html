The area, even the air, counts as difficult terrain for all creatures except you and creatures that have Fire Resistance. While inside the radius, creatures cannot be banished, plane shift, or otherwise leave by means that aren't simply walking out of the area. Similarly, creatures cannot enter via the previously mentioned methods. This area transformation lasts for 1 minute.<br><br>You can use this feature once, regaining its use on a long rest.

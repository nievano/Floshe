                Starting at 10th level, as bonus action, or as part of the same bonus action to activate any other transformation, you can transform yourself into a Brimstone Elemental. When first transforming, your max HP increases by 40, and then you heal by that amount. This extra max health's condition is saved when exiting the transformation, resetting after you get the full duration back. While transformed, You have immunity to fire damage, and resistance to non-magical physical damage. Your movement increases by 10 feet and you can move through lava as if it was water, and have a 'swimming speed' equal to your walking speed, and can walk on top of water and lava. Your Strength and Dexterity scores increases by 2, you have advantage on Constitution checks and all saving throws, and you count as one size larger when determining grappling and carry weight. Any creatures within 30 feet of you of your choice take 4d8 fire damage at the start of your turn. This transformation has a duration of 1 minute, which you can stop as another bonus action. Stopping the transformation early saves the remaining time left in the transformation for later. While in the underworld, the transformation timer is paused.<br><br>You regain the full duration for the transformation back on a short or long rest.

                Starting at 14th level, as an action, you can temporarily transform your surroundings into the Brimstone Crags, a world of fire, lava, and a sea of lost, tortured souls. Upon using this feature, you regain the temporary HP From your Resilience of the Archfiend feature, replacing any temporary HP you previously had, unless the previous amount was larger. The radius is 90 feet around you, which lasts for a minute, following everywhere you go with you as the center. Every creature except you while inside the Brimstone crags have their Fire immunity reduced to Resistance, Resistance reduced to nothing, and nothing reduced to Vulnerability. An already vulnerable creature always takes max fire damage. At the start of each of your turns while in the Brimstone Crags, you can cast the Fireball spell at 5th level for free (no action required by you). The area, even the air, counts as difficult terrain for all creatures except you and creatures that have Fire Resistance. While inside the radius, creatures cannot be banished, plane shift, or otherwise leave by means that aren't simply walking out of the area. Similarly, creatures cannot enter via the previously mentioned methods. This area transformation lasts for 1 minute.<br><br>You can use this feature once, regaining its use on a long rest.

                    Starting at 14th level, as an action, you can temporarily transform your surroundings into the Brimstone Crags, a world of fire, lava, and a sea of lost, tortured souls. Upon using this feature, you regain the temporary HP From your Resilience of the Archfiend feature, replacing any temporary HP you previously had, unless the previous amount was larger. The radius is 90 feet around you, which lasts for a minute, following everywhere you go with you as the center. Every creature except you while inside the Brimstone crags have their Fire immunity reduced to Resistance, Resistance reduced to nothing, and nothing reduced to Vulnerability. An already vulnerable creature always takes max fire damage. At the start of each of your turns while in the Brimstone Crags, you can cast the Fireball spell at 5th level for free (no action required by you). The area, even the air, counts as difficult terrain for all creatures except you and creatures that have Fire Resistance. While inside the radius, creatures cannot be banished, plane shift, or otherwise leave by means that aren't simply walking out of the area. Similarly, creatures cannot enter via the previously mentioned methods. This area transformation lasts for 1 minute.<br><br>You can use this feature once, regaining its use on a long rest.

                    Starting at 14th level, as bonus action or as a reaction to getting plane shifted, you can transform into your Voidling form. When first transforming, you can teleport yourself to a location you can see within 120 feet of yourself. While you're transformed, you can occupy friendly creatures spaces without any penalty, and other creatures spaces count as difficult terrain. You have immunity to Force damage, and resistance to non-magical physical damage. You are immune to involuntary Plane shifting or teleportation, and automatically succeed saving throws from Banish spells or similar effects. Void and Abyss creatures will regard you as one of their own during the duration. This transformation has a duration of 1 minute, which you can stop as another bonus action. Stopping the transformation early saves the remaining time left in the transformation for later. While in the Void, or the Abyss, the transformation timer is paused.
